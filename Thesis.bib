Planning and the documentation of performed activities are represented by a UML notation extended with stereotypes. The UML model supports the creation of the artifacts required by ISO 26262, enables document generation and a rigorous check of several constraints expressed in OCL. We illustrate our method using the example of an electronic steering column lock system.",

In previous work we introduced Workflow$^+$, a model-based framework for modelling the processes and work products in both the development and safety assurance life cycles. WF$^+$metamodels not only serve as templates that guide the development of a safe system, they also facilitate generation of an assurance case. In this paper, we explain the fundamentals of generating assurance cases from WF$^+$models as well as the advantages of doing this. We also discuss an initial evaluation of the application of WF$^+$in practice.",

	abstract="The shift of the automotive industry towards powertrain electrification introduces new automotive sensors, actuators and functions that lead to an increasing complexity of automotive embedded systems. The safety-criticality of these systems demands the application of analysis techniques such as PHA (Preliminary Hazard Analysis), FTA (Fault Tree Analysis) and FMEA (Failure Modes and Effects Analysis) in the development process. The early application of PHA allows to identify and classify hazards and to define top-level safety requirements. Building on this, the application of FTA and FMEA supports the verification of a system architecture defining an embedded system together with connected sensors and controlled actuators. This work presents a modeling framework with automated analysis and synthesis capabilities that supports a safety engineering workflow using the domain-specific language EAST-ADL. The contribution of this work is (1) the definition of properties that indicate the correct application of the workflow using the language. The properties and a model integrating the work products of the workflow are used for the automated detection of errors (property checker) and the automated suggestion and application of corrective measures (model corrector). Furthermore, (2) fault trees and a FMEA table can be automatically synthesized from the same model. The applicability of this computer-aided and tightly integrated approach is evaluated using the case study of a hybrid electric vehicle development.",

	abstract="The Goal Structuring Notation (GSN) is popular among safety engineers for modeling assurance cases. GSN elements are specified using plain natural language text, this giving safety engineers great flexibility to express their arguments. However, pure textual arguments introduce ambiguities and prevent automation. Currently, assurance cases are verified by manual reviews, which are error prone, time consuming, and not adequate for today's systems complexity and agile development methodologies. In this paper we present our research tool FASTEN.Safe, which extends GSN with a set of higher-level modeling language constructs capturing recurring argumentation patterns and integrating formal system models. This allows automatically checking 1) the intrinsic consistency of assurance models, 2) the consistency of arguments with system models and 3) the verification of safety claims themselves by using external verification tools. FASTEN.Safe is open source and allows experimenting with language abstractions to bridge the world of GSN-based arguments that are common among safety engineers and the world of formal methods that enable automation. Last but not least, we report on the preliminary experience gained with FASTEN.Safe.",

To achieve this, MMINT-A implements an impact assessment algorithm from previous work [7, 8] and incorporates a graphical assurance case editor, an annotation mechanism, and two summary tables for the assessment results. We demonstrate the usage of MMINT-A on a Power Sliding Door example from the automotive domain.",

	abstract="The ever-increasing complexity of safety-critical systems puts high demands on safety assurance and certification. We focus on the development of control software, where safety) requirements engineering plays a crucial and delicate role. Nowadays, most of the safety features are ensured by the (embedded) control software and, consequently, a great deal of the operational failures primarily originate from requirement errors. We apply formal methods to systematically specify, model, and validate safety (control) requirements, which we then employ to automatically synthesize a control design based on a formal model of the system at hand. The synthesized designs are correct by definition, provided that the models capture all safety aspects of the system. We structure the process in a synthesis-centric model-based systems engineering framework that we apply in an industrial case study involving safe coordination of movement of theme park vehicles. The framework provides rigorous means for modeling of safety requirements, and it supports evolvable product design, requirement reuse, and early integration with hardware prototypes for validation and testing.",

	abstract="Like most systems, automotive software systems evolve due to many reasons including adding, removing or modifying features, fixing bugs, or improving system quality. In this context, safety cases, used to demonstrate that a system satisfies predefined safety requirements, often dictated by a standard such as ISO 26262, need to co-evolve. A necessary step is performing an impact assessment to identify how changes in the system affect the safety case. In previous work, we introduced a generic model-based impact assessment approach, that, while sound, was not particularly precise. In this work, we show how exploiting knowledge about system changes, the particular safety case language, and the standard can increase the precision of the impact assessment, reducing any unnecessary revision work required by a safety engineer. We present six precision improvement techniques illustrated on a GSN safety case used with ISO 26262.",

For the development of such functions, the ISO 26262 demands a number of additional steps to be performed compared to common software engineering activities. We address some of these demands with means to semi-formally express software safety requirements, tools to automatically implement these requirements, and artifacts and traceability information that can be used for safety case documentation. Through a hierarchical classification of safety mechanisms, a semi-formal specification language for requirements, a generation engine and a case study on a production-model automotive system, we demonstrate: first, how expert knowledge of the functional safety domain can be captured, second, how the tedious and error prone task of manually implementing safety mechanisms can be automated, and third, how this serves as a basis for formal safety argumentation.",

However, the current shift towards model-based development has resulted in various new safety analysis methods, such as Component Integrated Fault Trees (CFT). Industry demands to know the benefits of these new methods. To compare CFT to FT, we conducted a controlled experiment in which 18 participants from industry and academia had to apply each method to safety modeling tasks from the avionics domain. Although the analysis of the solutions showed that the use of CFT did not yield a significantly different number of correct or incorrect solutions, the participants subjectively rated the modeling capacities of CFT significantly higher in terms of model consistency, clarity, and maintainability. The results are promising for the potential of CFT as a model-based approach.",

While this paradigm has been successfully applied for the development of embedded systems in various domains, new challenges have emerged from the development of safety critical systems that require certification against a specific standard. Existing SPLE approaches do not explicitly consider the various certification standards or levels that products should satisfy. In this paper, we focus on several practical issues involved in the SPLE process, establishing an infrastructure of a product line engineering for certified products. A metamodel is proposed to capture the entities involved in SPL certification and the relationships among them.

	abstract="Today's automobiles incorporate a great number of functions that are realized by software. An increasing number of safety-critical functions also follow this trend. For the development of such functions, the ISO 26262 demands a number of additional steps to be performed compared to common software engineering activities. We address some of these demands with means to semi-formally express software safety requirements, tools to automatically implement these requirements, and artifacts and traceability information that can be used for safety case documentation. Through a hierarchical classification of safety mechanisms, a semi-formal specification language for requirements, a generation engine and a case study on a production-model automotive system, we demonstrate: first, how expert knowledge of the functional safety domain can be captured, second, how the tedious and error prone task of manually implementing safety mechanisms can be automated, and third, how this serves as a basis for formal safety argumentation.",

	abstract="With the rapid progress in science and technology, we find ubiquitous use of safety-critical systems in avionics, consumer electronics, and medical instruments. In such systems, unintentional design faults might result in injury or even death to human beings. To avoid such mishaps, we need to verify safety-critical systems thoroughly, where formal verification techniques such as model checking play a very promising role. Currently, there is practically no automatic technique in formal verification used to formally model system faults and repairs. This work contributes in proposing an extension to the Safecharts model, with which faults and repairs can be easily modeled. Moreover, these Safecharts can be directly transformed into semantically equivalent Extended Timed Automata models for model checking. That is, after these models were integrated into a model checker, such as our previously proposed State Graph Manipulators (SGM) model checker, we can verify safety-critical systems. An application example is run to show the feasibility and benefits of the proposed model-driven verification method for safety-critical systems. As observed, the checking results, such as witnesses of property specifications representing hazards, provide more concrete and useful failure analysis information than the conventional Fault Tree Analysis (FTA).",

Different approaches have been developed and followed in the past. The approach presented has been developed in an evolutionary manner and by combining approaches described in literature. It turned out to be well suited for the medical device domain and is considered to be a best practice approach. As such it is part of the development process that must be followed when developing new medical devices. The development process has to be defined in a written way and is checked by T{\"U}V and FDA auditors on a yearly base. It is considered to be well above-average and thus may be adopted by other companies developing safety-relevant devices. During the audit process it is verified that the documentation of the process is as expected and that the actual development process is performed according to the defined process. This assures for companies adopting the approach that it is authenticated by daily practice and its use requires only modest overhead.",

We focus on the development of control software, where safety) requirements engineering plays a crucial and delicate role. Nowadays, most of the safety features are ensured by the (embedded) control software and, consequently, a great deal of the operational failures primarily originate from requirement errors. We apply formal methods to systematically specify, model, and validate safety (control) requirements, which we then employ to automatically synthesize a control design based on a formal model of the system at hand. The synthesized designs are correct by definition, provided that the models capture all safety aspects of the system. We structure the process in a synthesis-centric model-based systems engineering framework that we apply in an industrial case study involving safe coordination of movement of theme park vehicles. The framework provides rigorous means for modeling of safety requirements, and it supports evolvable product design, requirement reuse, and early integration with hardware prototypes for validation and testing.",

Using these terms of the railway domain, it facilitates the communication between domain experts and specialists for embedded control system development. Defined as a profile for UML 2.0, the development of precise RCSD descriptions is supported by standard UML tools, visualizing railway networks in the same way as domain experts are used to. The static description of networks is complemented by the characterization of the dynamics within the network with trains running on predefined routes. This behaviour is provided by the semantics of a state transition system derived from the object diagram of a particular network model. This rigorous semantic approach constitutes a prerequisite for further tool-supported analysis of safety requirements, and generation of the actual control system.",

A system can exhibit failure behaviour in many ways, including that from failures of individual or a small number of components. It is important for safety engineers to understand how system failure behaviour relates to failures exhibited by individual components. In this paper, we propose a safety analysis technique, failure propagation and transformation analysis (FPTA), which automatically and quantitatively analyses failures based on a model of failure logic. The technique integrates previous work on automated failure analysis with probabilistic model checking supported by the PRISM tool. We demonstrate the technique and tool on a small, yet realistic safety-related application.",

In this context, safety cases, used to demonstrate that a system satisfies predefined safety requirements, often dictated by a standard such as ISO 26262, need to co-evolve. A necessary step is performing an impact assessment to identify how changes in the system affect the safety case. In previous work, we introduced a generic model-based impact assessment approach, that, while sound, was not particularly precise. In this work, we show how exploiting knowledge about system changes, the particular safety case language, and the standard can increase the precision of the impact assessment, reducing any unnecessary revision work required by a safety engineer. We present six precision improvement techniques illustrated on a GSN safety case used with ISO 26262.",

Even if several (semi)automated safety case maintenance approaches have been proposed in the literature, currently, in the industry, the execution of this process is still manual, being error prone and expensive. To this end, we present in this paper the results of what is, to the best of our knowledge, the first Systematic Literature Review (SLR) conducted with the goal to provide a holistic overview of state-of-the-art safety case maintenance approaches. For each identified approach, we analyze its strengths and weaknesses. We observe that existing approaches are pessimistic, identifying a larger number of safety case elements as impacted by a change than the number of the actually impacted elements. Also, there is limited quantitative impact assessment. Further, existing approaches only address a few system change scenarios when providing guidelines for updating the safety case.",

However, for each architecture, this requires a specialized ISA simulator with tracing, injection, and error observation capabilities; a dependency that not only increases the bar for the exploration of ISA-level hardening mechanisms, but which can also deviate from the behavior of the actual hardware, especially when an error propagates through the system and triggers semantic edge cases.",

	abstract="Compliance with safety standards can greatly increase the development cost and time of critical systems. Major problems arise when evolutions to a system entail reconstruction of the body of safety evidence. When changes occur in the development or certification processes, identification of the new evidence to provide, the evidence that is no longer adequate, or the evidence that can be reused poses some challenges. Therefore, practitioners need support to identify how a chain of evidence evolves as a result of the changes. Otherwise, execution of the above activities can be very costly, and it can even result in abandonment of certification efforts. This paper outlines a solution to deal with these challenges. The solution is based on the use of model-driven engineering technology, which has already been applied for safety certification but not from an evolutionary chain of evidence-based perspective. The paper also sets the background for developing the solution, describes real situations in which the solution can help industry, and discusses possible challenges for developing it. The solution will be developed as part of OPENCOSS, a research project on cross-domain evolutionary certification.",

To reduce cost and effort tool chains can be composed of pre-qualified tools and then themselves pre-qualified by identifying the parts of tool chain software that have an impact on safety more exactly. In this paper we propose the use of a modeling language to describe this tool chain composition. This allows us to reduce effort even further by automatically analyzing the tool chain model for safety issues. It also promises to reduce the effort and cost of later steps in the deployment of the tool chain by formalizing the communication of safety issues and automating the generation of code for tool chain software.",

	abstract = {Cyber-physical systems that implement self-adaptive behavior, such as autonomous robots, need to ensure that requirements remain satisfied across run-time adaptations. The Robot Operating System (ROS), a middleware infrastructure for robotic systems, is widely used in both research and industrial applications. However, ROS itself does not assure self-adaptive behavior. This paper introduces AC-ROS, which fills this gap by using assurance case models at run time to manage the self-adaptive operation of ROS-based systems. Assurance cases provide structured arguments that a system satisfies requirements and can be specified graphically with Goal Structuring Notation (GSN) models. AC-ROS uses GSN models to instantiate a ROS-based MAPE-K framework, which in turn uses these models at run time to assure system behavior adheres to requirements across adaptations. For this study, AC-ROS is implemented and tested on EvoRally, a 1:5-scale autonomous vehicle.},

	abstract = {Requirements traceability is an important mechanism for managing verification, validation and change impact analysis challenges in system engineering. Numerous model-based approaches have been proposed to support requirements traceability, but significant challenges remain, including finding the appropriate level of granularity for modelling traceability and coping with the lack of uniformity in requirements management tools. This paper argues for an agile modelling approach to managing requirements traceability and, in this context, proposes a domain/project-specific requirements traceability modelling approach. The preliminary approach is illustrated briefly in the context of the safety-critical systems engineering domain, where agile traceability from functional and safety requirements is necessary to underpin certification.},

	abstract = {Assurance is a demonstration that a complex system (such as a car or a communication network) possesses an importantproperty, such as safety or security, with a high level of confidence. In contrast to currently dominant approaches to building assurance cases, which are focused on goal structuring and/or logical inference, we propose considering assurance as a model transformation (MT) enterprise: saying that a system possesses an assured property amounts to saying that a particular assurance view of the system comprising the assurance data, satisfies acceptance criteria posed as assurance constraints. While the MT realizing this view is very complex, we show that it can be decomposed into elementary MTs via a hierarchy of refinement steps. The transformations at the bottom level are ordinary MTs that can be executed for data specifying the system, thus providing the assurance data to be checked against the assurance constraints. In this way, assurance amounts to traversing the hierarchy from the top to the bottom and assuring the correctness of each MT in the path. Our approach has a precise mathematical foundation (rooted in process algebra and category theory) --- a necessity if we are to model precisely and then analyze our assurance cases. We discuss the practical applicability of the approach, and argue that it has several advantages over existing approaches.},

	abstract = {Autonomous vehicles controlled by advanced machine learning techniques are significantly gaining in popularity. However, the safety engineering practices currently used in such vehicles are not capable of justifying that AI techniques would prevent unsafe situations with a designated level of confidence and reliability. One related challenge is the perpetually changing environment that autonomous vehicles must interact with, which must be taken into consideration when deriving test suites for their safety assurance. As a result, a common approach for testing autonomous vehicles involves subjecting them to test scenarios and evaluating their system-level quality of service. As it stands, such system-level testing approaches do exist but only at a prototypical and conceptual level: these approaches cannot handle complex system-level traffic scenarios and related coverage criteria. I plan to address this challenge through my PhD studies by (1) defining situation coverage as an abstract coverage criteria for autonomous vehicle testing, (2) evaluating situation coverage of existing test suites obtained by off-the-shelf simulation tools, and (3) proposing a test suite generation approach that provides test scenarios with increasing situation coverage as output.},

	abstract = {Automatically synthesizing consistent models is a key prerequisite for many testing scenarios in autonomous driving or software tool validation where model-based systems engineering techniques are frequently used to ensure a designated coverage of critical cornercases. From a practical perspective, an inconsistent model is irrelevant as a test case (e.g. false positive), thus each synthetic model needs to simultaneously satisfy various structural and attribute well-formedness constraints. While different logic solvers or dedicated graph solvers have recently been developed, they fail to handle either structural or attribute constraints in a scalable way.In the current paper, we combine a structural graph solver that uses partial models with an SMT-solver to automatically derive models which simultaneously fulfill structural and attribute constraints while key theoretical properties of model generation like completeness or diversity are still ensured. This necessitates a sophisticated bidirectional interaction between different solvers which carry out consistency checks, decision, unit propagation, concretization steps. We evaluate the scalability and diversity of our approach in the context of three complex case studies.},

	abstract = {Both the Eclipse platform and MathWorks have successfully provided entire ecosystems and tooling for Model-Driven Engineering (MDE). On the one hand, the Eclipse community has built a rich set of open source tools and applications to address different MDE needs. Several of these tools and applications are actively used for developing academic and industrial systems. On the other hand, MathWorks with its Simulink and Stateflow technologies has focused on design modelling, simulation and code generation to deliver one of the most widely used modelling frameworks for developing embedded and safety-critical systems. Leveraging these two MDE ecosystems in the form of an integrated environment for embedded and safety-critical system development would be expected. Nonetheless, these two ecosystems rarely interact due to MathWorks' closed nature and proprietary file formats.This paper presents Breesse, a live bridge for the Eclipse Modeling Framework ecosystem and the MathWorks Simulink and Stateflow ecosystem. Breesse is an open source tool that was built in response to the needs of two industry partners who develop avionics systems. It was realized with EMF technologies and the MATLAB Engine API for Java. Breesse is able to import the contents of Simulink and Stateflow design models and libraries into EMF-based Simulink and Stateflow representations. These EMF-based representations enable the manipulation of the design models in other existing EMF-based tools for MDE. Evaluation of the tool was carried out through its use in three avionics system designs.},

	abstract = {As previously discussed [19], the challenges to achieve a consistent intertwining between safety and security are rather diverse and complex. Recent advances in safety and security suggest that risks analyses provide guidance for achieving a comprehensive alignment. However, for many domains, like in aeronautics, security is rather a recent concern whereas aircraft development has been mostly guided by safety criteria for several decades. The referred disparity along with the fact that security is, in many respects, a discipline still in evolution, imposes restrictions for specifying and applying methods to conduct safety and security co-engineering as a unified process. In this paper, we present the progress in the development of a model-based method, a framework and a tool useful to conduct a security risks analysis guided by safety criteria and goals. Among others, the approach relies on know-how found in the state of the art, in standards like ED202, ED203 (EUROCAE)1, as well as in open knowledge bases like CAPEC and CWE (MITRE)2. These sources are integrated which allows the instantiation of patterns of attacks, vulnerabilities, and architectures, which are crucial elements to semi-automate the analysis. A rule-based algorithm for exploring potential attack paths across an architecture is proposed and implemented. The approach is finally demonstrated by analyzing a combined attack-failure path in a Flight Control System which can undermine the safety of a modern aircraft. The framework and tool support seek safety-security by design and aim to facilitate the reuse of case studies and to settle a basis for repeatability and results comparison.},

	abstract = {Ensuring the functional correctness and safety of autonomous vehicles is a major challenge for the automotive industry. However, exhaustive physical test drives are not feasible, as billions of driven kilometers would be required to obtain reliable results. Scenario-based testing is an approach to tackle this problem and reduce necessary test drives by replacing driven kilometers with simulations of relevant or interesting scenarios. These scenarios can be generated or extracted from recorded data with machine learning algorithms or created by experts. In this paper, we propose a novel graphical scenario modeling language. The graphical framework allows experts to create new scenarios or review ones designed by other experts or generated by machine learning algorithms. The scenario description is modeled as a graph and based on behavior trees. It supports different abstraction levels of scenario description during software and test development. Additionally, the graph-based structure provides modularity and reusable sub-scenarios, an important use case in scenario modeling. A graphical visualization of the scenario enhances comprehensibility for different users. The presented approach eases the scenario creation process and increases the usage of scenarios within development and testing processes.},

The experience has been done inside a larger industrial project undertaken to evaluate the feasibility of employing formal modelling and automatic code generation in the development of a new generation of railway signalling systems hosted by a new fault-tolerant platform. The diversity is introduced at the level of the compilation of the generated code, and is aimed to discover possible faults due to the compilation environment or to the underlying operating system. Other forms of diversity will be then experimented in a step by step fashion.},

	abstract = {Safety-critical applications often use dependability cases to validate that specified properties are invariant, or to demonstrate a counter example showing how that property might be violated. However, most dependability cases are written with a single product in mind. At the same time, software product lines (families of related software products) have been studied with the goal of modeling variability and commonality, and building family based techniques for both analysis and testing. However, there has been little work on building an end to end dependability case for a software product line (where a property is modeled, a counter example is found and then validated as a true positive via testing), and none that we know of in an emerging safety-critical domain, that of robotic surgery. In this paper, we study a family of surgical robots, that combine hardware and software, and are highly configurable, representing over 1300 unique robots. At the same time, they are considered safety-critical and should have associated dependability cases. We perform a case study to understand how we can bring together lightweight formal analysis, feature modeling, and testing to provide an end to end pipeline to find potential violations of important safety properties. In the process, we learned that there are some interesting and open challenges for the research community, which if solved will lead towards more dependable safety-critical cyber-physical systems.},

	abstract = {Software safety certification involves checking that the software design meets the (software) safety requirements. In practice, inspections are one of the primary vehicles for ensuring that safety requirements are satisfied by the design. Unless the safety-related aspects of the design are clearly delineated, the inspections conducted by safety assessors would have to consider the entire design, although only small fragments of the design may be related to safety. In a model-driven development context, this means that the assessors have to browse through large models, understand them, and identify the safety-related fragments. This is time-consuming and error-prone, specially noting that the assessors are often third-party regulatory bodies who were not involved in the design. To address this problem, we describe in this paper a prototype tool called, SafeSlice, that enables one to automatically extract the safety-related slices (fragments) of design models. The main enabler for our slicing technique is the traceability between the safety requirements and the design, established by following a structured design methodology that we propose. Our work is grounded on SysML, which is being increasingly used for expressing the design of safety-critical systems. We have validated our work through two case studies and a control experiment which we briefly outline in the paper.},

Automated requirements traceability faces the low precision challenge due to a large number of false positives being returned and mingled with the true links. To overcome this challenge, we present a mutation-driven method built on the novel idea of proactively creating many seemingly correct tracing targets (i.e., mutants of a state machine diagram), and then exploiting model checking within process mining to automatically verify whether the safety requirement's properties hold in the mutants. A mutant is killed if its model checking fails; otherwise, it is survived. We leverage the underlying killed-survived distinction, and develop a correlation analysis procedure to identify the traceability links. Experimental evaluation results on two automotive systems with 27 safety requirements show considerable precision improvements compared with the state-of-the-art.},

Aviation authorities require avionics software suppliers to provide appropriate evidence of achieving DO-178C objectives for the verification of outputs from the requirements and design processes, and requirements-based testing. This concern is leading suppliers to consider and incorporate more effective engineering methods that can support them in their verification and certification endeavours. This paper presents SpecML, a modelling language providing a requirements specification infrastructure for avionics software. The goal of SpecML is threefold: 1) enforce certification information mandated by DO-178C, 2) capture requirements in natural language to encourage adoption in industry. and 3) capture requirements in a structured, semantically-rich formalism to enable requirements-based analyses and testing. The modelling language has been developed as a UML profile extending SysML Requirements. A reference implementation has been developed and experiences on its application to an openly-available avionics software specification are reported.},

	abstract = {Safety-critical software systems in the aviation domain, e.g., a UAV autopilot software, needs to go through a formal process of certification (e.g., DO-178C standard). One of the main requirements for this certification is having a set of explicit test cases for each software requirement. To achieve this, the DO-178C standard recommends using a model-driven approach. For instance, model-based testing (MBT) is recommended in its DO-331 supplement to automatically generate system-level test cases for the requirements provided as the specification models. In addition, the DO-178C standard also requires high level of source code coverage, which typically is achieved by a separate set of structural testing. However, the standard allows targeting high code coverage with MBT, only if the applicants justify their plan on how to achieve high code coverage through model-level testing.In this study, we propose using the Modified Condition and Decision coverage ("MC/DC") criterion on the specification-level constraints rather than the standard-recommended "all transition coverage" criterion, to achieve higher code coverage through MBT. We evaluate our approach in the context of a case study at MicroPilot Inc., our industry collaborator, which is a UAV producer company. We implemented our idea as an MC/DC coverage on transition guards in a UML state-machine-based testing tool that was developed in-house. The results show that applying model-level MC/DC coverage outperforms the typical transition-coverage (DO-178C's required MBT coverage criterion), with respect to source code-level "all condition-decision coverage criterion" by 33%. In addition, our MC/DC test suite detected three new faults and two instances of legacy specification in the code that are no longer in use, compared to the "all transition" test suite.},

In practice, there is a gap between what is prescribed by guidelines and what is implemented in practice, making it difficult for organizations and certifiers to fully evaluate the safety of the software system. In this paper we present an approach, which parses a guideline to extract a Traceability Model depicting software artifact types and their prescribed traces. It then analyzes the traceability data within a project to identify areas of traceability failure. Missing traceability paths, redundant and/or inconsistent data, and other problems are highlighted. We used our approach to evaluate the traceability of seven safety-critical software systems and found that none of the evaluated projects contained traceability that fully conformed to its relevant guidelines.},

	abstract = {Providing computer-based services for vehicular systems has evolved to the point where majority of functions are realised by software. However, the need to provide safety in critical functions such as braking and engine control requires an approach that can guarantee reliable operation of the functions. At the same time, there are a variety of vehicle functions that are less critical. The main challenge for the vehicle manufacturers is to provide both types of functions in an economic and reliable manner. To meet this challenge, this paper considers the Rubus tool chain for model- and component-based development of vehicle software and a well-proven (in the industrial use for over twenty years) and certified (according to ISO 26262) real-time operating system for its execution. The paper provides an overview of the Rubus approach and driving concepts as well as the research results that are used in providing its tool chain. Moreover, the paper presents a success story of a unique academic-industrial collaboration in the vehicle domain that has resulted in sustained development of the tool chain. The collaborators form a clear value chain from academia, through tool developer, to the end users of the technology. The paper also highlights the perspectives of the collaborators and discusses the challenges faced, experiences gained and lessons learned from several technology transfer projects.},

	abstract = {Software has emerged as a significant part of many domains, including financial service platforms, social networks and vehicle control. Standards organizations have responded to this by creating regulations to address issues such as safety and privacy. In this context, compliance of software with standards has emerged as a key issue. For software development organizations, compliance is a complex and costly goal to achieve and is often accomplished by producing so-called assurance cases, which demonstrate that the system indeed satisfies the property imposed by a standard (e.g., safety, privacy, security). As systems and standards undergo evolution for a variety of reasons, maintaining assurance cases multiplies the effort. In this work, we propose to exploit the connection between the field of model management and the problem of compliance management and propose methods that use model management techniques to address compliance scenarios such as assurance case evolution and reuse. For validation, we ground our approaches on the automotive domain and the ISO 26262 standard for functional safety of road vehicles.},

We aim to provide evidence of the extent to which models improve the understanding of safety compliance needs. Method. We designed an experiment and ran a pilot to study the effectiveness, efficiency, and perceived benefits of understanding these needs, with the text of standards and with models in the form of UML object diagrams. Results. The overall results from 15 Bachelor students show that the effectiveness of understanding safety compliance needs increases very little with models (2%), and the efficiency even decreases (24%). Nonetheless, the results improve when the potential complexity in navigating the models is taken into account (15% effectiveness increase). The students find benefits in using the models but most consider that the models are hard to understand. Conclusions. The extent to which models improve the understanding of safety compliance needs seems to be lower than what the research community expects. New studies are necessary to confirm our initial insights.},

	abstract = {System traceability from requirements to implementation is desirable, often mandatory, for complex and safety-critical system development. However, maintaining traceability documentation can be extremely taxing and tedious through iterative and incremental development life cycles. The problem is further exacerbated when product variability is introduced in the system development. Feature modelling and product line engineering are becoming increasingly common in safety-critical domains such as the automotive domain when manufacturers must consider maintaining documentation for multiple variations of a single vehicle. This problem is made even more complex by the yearly iterations they have on their vehicles. Thus, we introduce CyclicL, a tool for developing, managing, and modelling feature-requirement traceability through iterative and incremental development strategies. CyclicL is designed to facilitate traceability between features and requirements through various product iterations, and multiple incremental feature and requirement changes.},

However, a gap exists when it comes to identifying reusable products, and requirements across iterations of features.

We propose a methodology for using features to encapsulate requirements by establishing a clear hierarchy between features and requirements.
