\chapter{Literature Review}

\section{Research Method}
There were three main pillars that were used to direct this literature review; \ac{MDE}, \ac{PLE}, traceability, and requirement engineering. The scope for traceability is limited to connections between \ac{PLE}, feature models, and requirements. Since another focus for this research is using \ac{MDE} techniques and tooling we also scope all results to include some sort of \ac{MDE}. Thus, the search strings used for this literature review are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item (``model driven engineering" OR ``model based engineering") AND (``product line engineering" OR ``feature modelling") AND ``tools"
	\item (``model driven engineering" OR ``model based engineering") AND ``traceability" AND ``tools"
	\item ``traceability" AND (``product line engineering" OR ``feature modelling") AND ``tools"
	\item ``traceability" AND (``requirement modelling" OR ``requirement diagrams") AND ``tools"
\end{itemize}

Results using these search strings were chosen from the initial search results from Google Scholar and the following conferences:
\begin{itemize}
	\item International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE). 
	\item International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems (MODELS). 
	\item Software Product Line Conference (SPLC).
	\item Variability Modelling of Software-Intensive Systems (VaMoS).
\end{itemize}

\section{Inclusion Criteria}

In order to deem a resulting publication to be relevant to this body of work the following criteria needed to be met:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The publication should use \ac{MDE} techniques AND address \ac{PLE} OR requirement engineering. The publication can focus on development in any applied domain, though of particular interest are automotive and medical device development. 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Of particular interest are applications of feature modelling in industry. 
		\item Of particular interest are application of \ac{MDE} techniques for requirement engineering and modelling.
	\end{itemize}
	\item The publication should explore traceability. This can be done either for requirements OR \ac{PLE} though ideally the publication should explore traceability explicitly between \ac{PLE} and requirements. This also includes methodologies for automated traceability.
	\item The publication should have tool support for traceability, \ac{PLE}, or/and requirement modelling. 
\end{itemize}
